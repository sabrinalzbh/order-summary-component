# ORDER- SUMMARY-COMPONENT

Hey there!!

I wanted to freshen up my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. 
In this particular project, its main focus was HTML & CSS. With the help of #freecodecamp & #frontendmentor - I was able to build a 
component/card from scratch. 

The main goal was to follow the original design for this card verbatim. 

This was a very easy & helpful refresher course and it is truly beginner friendly. :) 

If you're interested in hitting the basics, I say go for this project. 



Thanks for stopping by! <3
